	abstract = {We introduce a methodology to assess differential abundance in sparse high-throughput microbial marker-gene survey data. Our approach, implemented in the {metagenomeSeq} Bioconductor package, relies on a novel normalization technique and a statistical model that accounts for undersampling—a common feature of large-scale marker-gene studies. Using simulated data and several published microbiota data sets, we show that {metagenomeSeq} outperforms the tools currently used in this field.},
