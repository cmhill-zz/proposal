\section{Introduction}

Microbes play a huge role in every aspect of our life. {\bf digestion, disease, ...}.

Advances in sequencing technology allows us to capture a snapshot of the microbial community/better understand the role microbes play in our life.

Typical analyses involve clustering the sequences into similar operational taxonmic units (OTUs).

Clustering is a widely-studied problem in computer science.

Computing the pair-wise distance are expensive and impractical in practice.
