	abstract = {The {BLAST} programs are widely used tools for searching protein and {DNA} databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the {BLAST} programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped {BLAST} program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by {BLAST} into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated {BLAST} ({PSIBLAST)} program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped {BLAST}, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. {PSI-BLAST} is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the {BRCT} superfamily.},

	abstract = {Motivation The discovery of novel biological knowledge from the ab initio analysis of post-genomic data relies upon the use of unsupervised processing methods, in particular clustering techniques. Much recent research in bioinformatics has therefore been focused on the transfer of clustering methods introduced in other scientific fields and on the development of novel algorithms specifically designed to tackle the challenges posed by post-genomic data. The partitions returned by a clustering algorithm are commonly validated using visual inspection and concordance with prior biological knowledge—whether the clusters actually correspond to the real structure in the data is somewhat less frequently considered. Suitable computational cluster validation techniques are available in the general data-mining literature, but have been given only a fraction of the same attention in bioinformatics.
Results This review paper aims to familiarize the reader with the battery of techniques available for the validation of clustering results, with a particular focus on their application to post-genomic data analysis. Synthetic and real biological datasets are used to demonstrate the benefits, and also some of the perils, of analytical cluster validation.

This program can efficiently cluster a huge protein database with millions of sequences. However, the applications of the underlying algorithm are not limited to only protein sequences clustering, here we present several new programs using the same algorithm including cd-hit-2d, cd-hit-est and cd-hit-est-2d. Cd-hit-2d compares two protein datasets and reports similar matches between them; cd-hit-est clusters a {DNA/RNA} sequence database and cd-hit-est-2d compares two nucleotide datasets. All these programs can handle huge datasets with millions of sequences and can be hundreds of times faster than methods based on the popular sequence comparison and database search tools, such as {BLAST.}

At the same time, deep sequencing can lead to overestimates of microbial diversity through the generation of low-frequency, error-prone reads. Even with sequencing error rates below 0.005 per nucleotide position, the common method of generating operational taxonomic units ({OTUs)} by multiple sequence alignment and complete-linkage clustering significantly increases the number of predicted {OTUs} and inflates richness estimates. We show that a 2\% single-linkage preclustering methodology followed by an average-linkage clustering based on pairwise alignments more accurately predicts expected {OTUs} in both single and pooled template preparations of known taxonomic composition. This new clustering method can reduce the {OTU} richness in environmental samples by as much as 30–60\% but does not reduce the fraction of {OTUs} in long-tailed rank abundance curves that defines the rare biosphere.},

	abstract = {Massively parallel pyrosequencing of the small subunit ({16S)} ribosomal {RNA} gene has revealed that the extent of rare microbial populations in several environments, the 'rare biosphere', is orders of magnitude higher than previously thought. One important caveat with this method is that sequencing error could artificially inflate diversity estimates. Although the per-base error of {16S} {rDNA} amplicon pyrosequencing has been shown to be as good as or lower than Sanger sequencing, no direct assessments of pyrosequencing errors on diversity estimates have been reported. Using only Escherichia coli {MG1655} as a reference template, we find that {16S} {rDNA} diversity is grossly overestimated unless relatively stringent read quality filtering and low clustering thresholds are applied. In particular, the common practice of removing reads with unresolved bases and anomalous read lengths is insufficient to ensure accurate estimates of microbial diversity. Furthermore, common and reproducible homopolymer length errors can result in relatively abundant spurious phylotypes further confounding data interpretation. We suggest that stringent quality-based trimming of {16S} pyrotags and clustering thresholds no greater than 97\% identity should be used to avoid overestimates of the rare biosphere.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Similarity clustering of next-generation sequences ({NGS)} is an important computational problem to study the population sizes of {DNA/RNA} molecules and to reduce the redundancies in {NGS} data. Currently, most sequence clustering algorithms are limited by their speed and scalability, and thus cannot handle data with tens of millions of reads.
Results: Here, we introduce {SEED—an} efficient algorithm for clustering very large {NGS} sets. It joins sequences into clusters that can differ by up to three mismatches and three overhanging residues from their virtual center. It is based on a modified spaced seed method, called block spaced seeds. Its clustering component operates on the hash tables by first identifying virtual center sequences and then finding all their neighboring sequences that meet the similarity parameters. {SEED} can cluster 100 million short read sequences in {\textless}4 h with a linear time and memory performance. When using {SEED} as a preprocessing tool on genome/transcriptome assembly data, it was able to reduce the time and memory requirements of the {Velvet/Oasis} assembler for the datasets used in this study by 60–85\% and 21–41\%, respectively. In addition, the assemblies contained longer contigs than non-preprocessed data as indicated by 12–27\% larger N50 values. Compared with other clustering tools, {SEED} showed the best performance in generating clusters of {NGS} data similar to true cluster results with a 2- to 10-fold better time performance. While most of {SEED's} utilities fall into the preprocessing area of {NGS} data, our tests also demonstrate its efficiency as stand-alone tool for discovering clusters of small {RNA} sequences in {NGS} data from unsequenced organisms.

Hierarchical clustering is one of the most widely employed approaches to finding operational taxonomic units, the basis for many downstream analyses. Most existing algorithms have quadratic space and computational complexities, and thus can be used only for small or medium-scale problems. We propose a new online learning-based algorithm that simultaneously addresses the space and computational issues of prior work. The basic idea is to partition a sequence space into a set of subspaces using a partition tree constructed using a pseudometric, then recursively refine a clustering structure in these subspaces. The technique relies on new methods for fast closest-pair searching and efficient dynamic insertion and deletion of tree nodes. To avoid exhaustive computation of pairwise distances between clusters, we represent each cluster of sequences as a probabilistic sequence, and define a set of operations to align these probabilistic sequences and compute genetic distances between them. We present analyses of space and computational complexity, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new algorithm using a human gut microbiota data set with over one million sequences. The new algorithm exhibits a quasilinear time and space complexity comparable to greedy heuristic clustering algorithms, while achieving a similar accuracy to the standard hierarchical clustering algorithm.},

	doi = {10.1109/BIBM.2010.5706555},
	abstract = {{16S} {rRNA} gene profiling has recently been boosted by the development of pyrosequencing methods. A common analysis is to group pyrosequences into Operational Taxonomic Units ({OTUs)}, such that reads in an {OTU} are likely sampled from the same species. However, species diversity estimated from error-prone {16S} {rRNA} pyrosequences may be inflated because the reads sampled from the same {16S} {rRNA} gene may appear different, and current {OTU} inference approaches typically involve time-consuming pairwise/multiple distance calculation and clustering. I propose a novel approach Abun-{dantOTU} based on a Consensus Alignment ({CA)} algorithm, which infers consensus sequences, each representing an {OTU}, taking advantage of the sequence redundancy for abundant species. Pyrosequencing reads can then be recruited to the consensus sequences to give quantitative information for the corresponding species. As tested on {16S} {rRNA} pyrosequence datasets from mock communities with known species, Abun-{dantOTU} rapidly reported identified sequences of the source {16S} {rRNAs} and the abundances of the corresponding species. {AbundantOTU} was also applied to {16S} {rRNA} pyrosequence datasets derived from real microbial communities and the results are in general agreement with previous studies.},

	abstract = {Summary: {CD-HIT} is a widely used program for clustering biological sequences to reduce sequence redundancy and improve the performance of other sequence analyses. In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new {CD-HIT} program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to ∼24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to ∼8 cores. The enhanced {CD-HIT} is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions.

	abstract = {The rapid advances of high-throughput sequencing technologies dramatically prompted metagenomic studies of microbial communities that exist at various environments. Fundamental questions in metagenomics include the identities, composition and dynamics of microbial populations and their functions and interactions. However, the massive quantity and the comprehensive complexity of these sequence data pose tremendous challenges in data analysis. These challenges include but are not limited to ever-increasing computational demand, biased sequence sampling, sequence errors, sequence artifacts and novel sequences. Sequence clustering methods can directly answer many of the fundamental questions by grouping similar sequences into families. In addition, clustering analysis also addresses the challenges in metagenomics. Thus, a large redundant data set can be represented with a small non-redundant set, where each cluster can be represented by a single entry or a consensus. Artifacts can be rapidly detected through clustering. Errors can be identified, filtered or corrected by using consensus from sequences within clusters.},

	abstract = {{16S} {rRNA} sequencing, commonly used to survey microbial communities, begins by grouping individual reads into operational taxonomic units ({OTUs).} There are two major challenges in calling {OTUs:} identifying bacterial population boundaries and differentiating true diversity from sequencing errors. Current approaches to identifying taxonomic groups or eliminating sequencing errors rely on sequence data alone, but both of these activities could be informed by the distribution of sequences across samples. Here, we show that using the distribution of sequences across samples can help identify population boundaries even in noisy sequence data. The logic underlying our approach is that bacteria in different populations will often be highly correlated in their abundance across different samples. Conversely, {16S} {rRNA} sequences derived from the same population, whether slightly different copies in the same organism, variation of the {16S} {rRNA} gene within a population, or sequences generated randomly in error, will have the same underlying distribution across sampled environments. We present a simple {OTU-calling} algorithm (distribution-based clustering) that uses both genetic distance and the distribution of sequences across samples and demonstrate that it is more accurate than other methods at grouping reads into {OTUs} in a mock community. Distribution-based clustering also performs well on environmental samples: it is sensitive enough to differentiate between {OTUs} that differ by a single base pair yet predicts fewer overall {OTUs} than most other methods. The program can decrease the total number of {OTUs} with redundant information and improve the power of many downstream analyses to describe biologically relevant trends.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Nucleotide sequence data are being produced at an ever increasing rate. Clustering such sequences by similarity is often an essential first step in their analysis—intended to reduce redundancy, define gene families or suggest taxonomic units. Exact clustering algorithms, such as hierarchical clustering, scale relatively poorly in terms of run time and memory usage, yet they are desirable because heuristic shortcuts taken during clustering might have unintended consequences in later analysis steps.
Results: Here we present {HPC-CLUST}, a highly optimized software pipeline that can cluster large numbers of pre-aligned {DNA} sequences by running on distributed computing hardware. It allocates both memory and computing resources efficiently, and can process more than a million sequences in a few hours on a small cluster.
Availability and implementation: Source code and binaries are freely available at http://meringlab.org/software/hpc-clust/; the pipeline is implemented in C++ and uses the Message Passing Interface ({MPI)} standard for distributed computing.
