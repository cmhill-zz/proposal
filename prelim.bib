It is shown how the searches can be done fast using the suffix tree of T augmented with the suffix links as the preprocessed form of T and applying dynamic programming over the tree. Three variations of the search algorithm are developed with running times O(mq + n), O(mq log q + size of the output), and O(m 2 q + size of the output).

	abstract = {Taxonomy-independent analysis plays an essential role in microbial community analysis. Hierarchical clustering is one of the most widely employed approaches to finding operational taxonomic units, the basis for many downstream analyses. Most existing algorithms have quadratic space and computational complexities, and thus can be used only for small or medium-scale problems. We propose a new online learning-based algorithm that simultaneously addresses the space and computational issues of prior work. The basic idea is to partition a sequence space into a set of subspaces using a partition tree constructed using a pseudometric, then recursively refine a clustering structure in these subspaces. The technique relies on new methods for fast closest-pair searching and efficient dynamic insertion and deletion of tree nodes. To avoid exhaustive computation of pairwise distances between clusters, we represent each cluster of sequences as a probabilistic sequence, and define a set of operations to align these probabilistic sequences and compute genetic distances between them. We present analyses of space and computational complexity, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new algorithm using a human gut microbiota data set with over one million sequences. The new algorithm exhibits a quasilinear time and space complexity comparable to greedy heuristic clustering algorithms, while achieving a similar accuracy to the standard hierarchical clustering algorithm.},

Fundamental questions in metagenomics include the identities, composition and dynamics of microbial populations and their functions and interactions. However, the massive quantity and the comprehensive complexity of these sequence data pose tremendous challenges in data analysis. These challenges include but are not limited to ever-increasing computational demand, biased sequence sampling, sequence errors, sequence artifacts and novel sequences. Sequence clustering methods can directly answer many of the fundamental questions by grouping similar sequences into families. In addition, clustering analysis also addresses the challenges in metagenomics. Thus, a large redundant data set can be represented with a small non-redundant set, where each cluster can be represented by a single entry or a consensus. Artifacts can be rapidly detected through clustering. Errors can be identified, filtered or corrected by using consensus from sequences within clusters.},

	abstract = {Motivation The discovery of novel biological knowledge from the ab initio analysis of post-genomic data relies upon the use of unsupervised processing methods, in particular clustering techniques. Much recent research in bioinformatics has therefore been focused on the transfer of clustering methods introduced in other scientific fields and on the development of novel algorithms specifically designed to tackle the challenges posed by post-genomic data. The partitions returned by a clustering algorithm are commonly validated using visual inspection and concordance with prior biological knowledge—whether the clusters actually correspond to the real structure in the data is somewhat less frequently considered. Suitable computational cluster validation techniques are available in the general data-mining literature, but have been given only a fraction of the same attention in bioinformatics.
Results This review paper aims to familiarize the reader with the battery of techniques available for the validation of clustering results, with a particular focus on their application to post-genomic data analysis. Synthetic and real biological datasets are used to demonstrate the benefits, and also some of the perils, of analytical cluster validation.

Cd-hit-2d compares two protein datasets and reports similar matches between them; cd-hit-est clusters a {DNA/RNA} sequence database and cd-hit-est-2d compares two nucleotide datasets. All these programs can handle huge datasets with millions of sequences and can be hundreds of times faster than methods based on the popular sequence comparison and database search tools, such as {BLAST.}

	abstract = {{16S} {rRNA} sequencing, commonly used to survey microbial communities, begins by grouping individual reads into operational taxonomic units ({OTUs).} There are two major challenges in calling {OTUs:} identifying bacterial population boundaries and differentiating true diversity from sequencing errors. Current approaches to identifying taxonomic groups or eliminating sequencing errors rely on sequence data alone, but both of these activities could be informed by the distribution of sequences across samples. Here, we show that using the distribution of sequences across samples can help identify population boundaries even in noisy sequence data. The logic underlying our approach is that bacteria in different populations will often be highly correlated in their abundance across different samples. Conversely, {16S} {rRNA} sequences derived from the same population, whether slightly different copies in the same organism, variation of the {16S} {rRNA} gene within a population, or sequences generated randomly in error, will have the same underlying distribution across sampled environments. We present a simple {OTU-calling} algorithm (distribution-based clustering) that uses both genetic distance and the distribution of sequences across samples and demonstrate that it is more accurate than other methods at grouping reads into {OTUs} in a mock community. Distribution-based clustering also performs well on environmental samples: it is sensitive enough to differentiate between {OTUs} that differ by a single base pair yet predicts fewer overall {OTUs} than most other methods. The program can decrease the total number of {OTUs} with redundant information and improve the power of many downstream analyses to describe biologically relevant trends.},

	abstract = {Metagenomics is a discipline that enables the genomic study of uncultured microorganisms. Faster, cheaper sequencing technologies and the ability to sequence uncultured microbes sampled directly from their habitats are expanding and transforming our view of the microbial world. Distilling meaningful information from the millions of new genomic sequences presents a serious challenge to bioinformaticians. In cultured microbes, the genomic data come from a single clone, making sequence assembly and annotation tractable. In metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous microbial communities, sometimes containing more than 10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and partial. From sampling, to assembly, to gene calling and function prediction, bioinformatics faces new demands in interpreting voluminous, noisy, and often partial sequence data. Although metagenomics is a relative newcomer to science, the past few years have seen an explosion in computational methods applied to metagenomic-based research. It is therefore not within the scope of this article to provide an exhaustive review. Rather, we provide here a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the current computational requirements presented by metagenomics, and review the recent progress made. We also note whether there is software that implements any of the methods presented here, and briefly review its utility. Nevertheless, it would be useful if readers of this article would avail themselves of the comment section provided by this journal, and relate their own experiences. Finally, the last section of this article provides a few representative studies illustrating different facets of recent scientific discoveries made using metagenomics.},

At the same time, deep sequencing can lead to overestimates of microbial diversity through the generation of low-frequency, error-prone reads. Even with sequencing error rates below 0.005 per nucleotide position, the common method of generating operational taxonomic units ({OTUs)} by multiple sequence alignment and complete-linkage clustering significantly increases the number of predicted {OTUs} and inflates richness estimates. We show that a 2\% single-linkage preclustering methodology followed by an average-linkage clustering based on pairwise alignments more accurately predicts expected {OTUs} in both single and pooled template preparations of known taxonomic composition. This new clustering method can reduce the {OTU} richness in environmental samples by as much as 30–60\% but does not reduce the fraction of {OTUs} in long-tailed rank abundance curves that defines the rare biosphere.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Similarity clustering of next-generation sequences ({NGS)} is an important computational problem to study the population sizes of {DNA/RNA} molecules and to reduce the redundancies in {NGS} data. Currently, most sequence clustering algorithms are limited by their speed and scalability, and thus cannot handle data with tens of millions of reads.
Results: Here, we introduce {SEED—an} efficient algorithm for clustering very large {NGS} sets. It joins sequences into clusters that can differ by up to three mismatches and three overhanging residues from their virtual center. It is based on a modified spaced seed method, called block spaced seeds. Its clustering component operates on the hash tables by first identifying virtual center sequences and then finding all their neighboring sequences that meet the similarity parameters. {SEED} can cluster 100 million short read sequences in {\textless}4 h with a linear time and memory performance. When using {SEED} as a preprocessing tool on genome/transcriptome assembly data, it was able to reduce the time and memory requirements of the {Velvet/Oasis} assembler for the datasets used in this study by 60–85\% and 21–41\%, respectively. In addition, the assemblies contained longer contigs than non-preprocessed data as indicated by 12–27\% larger N50 values. Compared with other clustering tools, {SEED} showed the best performance in generating clusters of {NGS} data similar to true cluster results with a 2- to 10-fold better time performance. While most of {SEED's} utilities fall into the preprocessing area of {NGS} data, our tests also demonstrate its efficiency as stand-alone tool for discovering clusters of small {RNA} sequences in {NGS} data from unsequenced organisms.

Given that skin bacterial communities are personalized, we hypothesized that we could use the residual skin bacteria left on objects for forensic identification, matching the bacteria on the object to the skin-associated bacteria of the individual who touched the object. Here we describe a series of studies de-monstrating the validity of this approach. We show that skin-associated bacteria can be readily recovered from surfaces (including single computer keys and computer mice) and that the structure of these communities can be used to differentiate objects handled by different individuals, even if those objects have been left untouched for up to 2 weeks at room temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can use a high-throughput pyrosequencing-based ap-proach to quantitatively compare the bacterial communities on objects and skin to match the object to the individual with a high degree of certainty. Although additional work is needed to further establish the utility of this approach, this series of studies introduces a forensics approach that could eventually be used to independently evaluate results obtained using more traditional forensic practices.},

	abstract = {Massively parallel pyrosequencing of the small subunit ({16S)} ribosomal {RNA} gene has revealed that the extent of rare microbial populations in several environments, the 'rare biosphere', is orders of magnitude higher than previously thought. One important caveat with this method is that sequencing error could artificially inflate diversity estimates. Although the per-base error of {16S} {rDNA} amplicon pyrosequencing has been shown to be as good as or lower than Sanger sequencing, no direct assessments of pyrosequencing errors on diversity estimates have been reported. Using only Escherichia coli {MG1655} as a reference template, we find that {16S} {rDNA} diversity is grossly overestimated unless relatively stringent read quality filtering and low clustering thresholds are applied. In particular, the common practice of removing reads with unresolved bases and anomalous read lengths is insufficient to ensure accurate estimates of microbial diversity. Furthermore, common and reproducible homopolymer length errors can result in relatively abundant spurious phylotypes further confounding data interpretation. We suggest that stringent quality-based trimming of {16S} pyrotags and clustering thresholds no greater than 97\% identity should be used to avoid overestimates of the rare biosphere.},

We analyzed ∼78 million base pairs of unique {DNA} sequence and 2062 polymerase chain reaction–amplified {16S} ribosomal {DNA} sequences obtained from the fecal {DNAs} of two healthy adults. Using metabolic function analyses of identified genes, we compared our human genome with the average content of previously sequenced microbial genomes. Our microbiome has significantly enriched metabolism of glycans, amino acids, and xenobiotics; methanogenesis; and 2-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway–mediated biosynthesis of vitamins and isoprenoids. Thus, humans are superorganisms whose metabolism represents an amalgamation of microbial and human attributes.},

	abstract = {Understanding the consequences of regulatory variation in the human genome remains a major challenge, with important implications for understanding gene regulation and interpreting the many disease-risk variants that fall outside of protein-coding regions. Here, we provide a direct window into the regulatory consequences of genetic variation by sequencing {RNA} from 922 genotyped individuals. We present a comprehensive description of the distribution of regulatory variation - by the specific expression phenotypes altered, the properties of affected genes, and the genomic characteristics of regulatory variants. We detect variants influencing expression of over ten thousand genes, and through the enhanced resolution offered by {RNA-sequencing}, for the first time we identify thousands of variants associated with specific phenotypes including splicing and allelic expression. Evaluating the effects of both long-range intra-chromosomal and trans (cross-chromosomal) regulation, we observe modularity in the regulatory network, with three-dimensional chromosomal configuration playing a particular role in regulatory modules within each chromosome. We also observe a significant depletion of regulatory variants affecting central and critical genes, along with a trend of reduced effect sizes as variant frequency increases, providing evidence that purifying selection and buffering have limited the deleterious impact of regulatory variation on the cell. Further, generalizing beyond observed variants, we have analyzed the genomic properties of variants associated with expression and splicing, and developed a Bayesian model to predict regulatory consequences of genetic variants, applicable to the interpretation of individual genomes and disease studies. Together, these results represent a critical step toward characterizing the complete landscape of human regulatory variation.},

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the {BLAST} programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped {BLAST} program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by {BLAST} into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated {BLAST} ({PSIBLAST)} program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped {BLAST}, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. {PSI-BLAST} is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the {BRCT} superfamily.},

	abstract = {{16S} {rRNA} gene profiling has recently been boosted by the development of pyrosequencing methods. A common analysis is to group pyrosequences into Operational Taxonomic Units ({OTUs)}, such that reads in an {OTU} are likely sampled from the same species. However, species diversity estimated from error-prone {16S} {rRNA} pyrosequences may be inflated because the reads sampled from the same {16S} {rRNA} gene may appear different, and current {OTU} inference approaches typically involve time-consuming pairwise/multiple distance calculation and clustering. I propose a novel approach Abun-{dantOTU} based on a Consensus Alignment ({CA)} algorithm, which infers consensus sequences, each representing an {OTU}, taking advantage of the sequence redundancy for abundant species. Pyrosequencing reads can then be recruited to the consensus sequences to give quantitative information for the corresponding species. As tested on {16S} {rRNA} pyrosequence datasets from mock communities with known species, Abun-{dantOTU} rapidly reported identified sequences of the source {16S} {rRNAs} and the abundances of the corresponding species. {AbundantOTU} was also applied to {16S} {rRNA} pyrosequence datasets derived from real microbial communities and the results are in general agreement with previous studies.},

Clustering such sequences by similarity is often an essential first step in their analysis—intended to reduce redundancy, define gene families or suggest taxonomic units. Exact clustering algorithms, such as hierarchical clustering, scale relatively poorly in terms of run time and memory usage, yet they are desirable because heuristic shortcuts taken during clustering might have unintended consequences in later analysis steps.
Results: Here we present {HPC-CLUST}, a highly optimized software pipeline that can cluster large numbers of pre-aligned {DNA} sequences by running on distributed computing hardware. It allocates both memory and computing resources efficiently, and can process more than a million sequences in a few hours on a small cluster.

To carry out analysis on gut microbial content in patients with type 2 diabetes, we developed a protocol for a metagenome-wide association study ({MGWAS)} and undertook a two-stage {MGWAS} based on deep shotgun sequencing of the gut microbial {DNA} from 345 Chinese individuals. We identified and validated approximately 60,000 type-2-diabetes-associated markers and established the concept of a metagenomic linkage group, enabling taxonomic species-level analyses. {MGWAS} analysis showed that patients with type 2 diabetes were characterized by a moderate degree of gut microbial dysbiosis, a decrease in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in various opportunistic pathogens, as well as an enrichment of other microbial functions conferring sulphate reduction and oxidative stress resistance. An analysis of 23 additional individuals demonstrated that these gut microbial markers might be useful for classifying type 2 diabetes.

Fundamental questions in metagenomics include the identities, composition and dynamics of microbial populations and their functions and interactions. However, the massive quantity and the comprehensive complexity of these sequence data pose tremendous challenges in data analysis. These challenges include but are not limited to ever-increasing computational demand, biased sequence sampling, sequence errors, sequence artifacts and novel sequences. Sequence clustering methods can directly answer many of the fundamental questions by grouping similar sequences into families. In addition, clustering analysis also addresses the challenges in metagenomics. Thus, a large redundant data set can be represented with a small non-redundant set, where each cluster can be represented by a single entry or a consensus. Artifacts can be rapidly detected through clustering. Errors can be identified, filtered or corrected by using consensus from sequences within clusters.},

From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development.
The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match.
Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to ∼24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to ∼8 cores. The enhanced {CD-HIT} is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions.

	abstract = {Motivation: Biological sequence data is accumulating rapidly, motivating the development of improved high-throughput methods for sequence classification.
Results: {UBLAST} and {USEARCH} are new algorithms enabling sensitive local and global search of large sequence databases at exceptionally high speeds. They are often orders of magnitude faster than {BLAST} in practical applications, though sensitivity to distant protein relationships is lower. {UCLUST} is a new clustering method that exploits {USEARCH} to assign sequences to clusters. {UCLUST} offers several advantages over the widely used program {CD-HIT}, including higher speed, lower memory use, improved sensitivity, clustering at lower identities and classification of much larger datasets.

A total of 1.045 billion base pairs of nonredundant sequence was generated, annotated, and analyzed to elucidate the gene content, diversity, and relative abundance of the organisms within these environmental samples. These data are estimated to derive from at least 1800 genomic species based on sequence relatedness, including 148 previously unknown bacterial phylotypes. We have identified over 1.2 million previously unknown genes represented in these samples, including more than 782 new rhodopsin-like photoreceptors. Variation in species present and stoichiometry suggests substantial oceanic microbial diversity.},
